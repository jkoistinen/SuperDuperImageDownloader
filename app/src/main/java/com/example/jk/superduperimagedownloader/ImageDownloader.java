    // 1. Firing of a API request to some API that provides images.
    // 2. Parse the fullsize image URL from API response (or maybe a smaller version and larger version, depends on what API)
    // 3. Insert the parsed results to ArrayList imageUrls

    // 4. Maybe notify the adapter also to get new changes in ListView?
